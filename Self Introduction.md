Can you tell me about yourself ?（是否适合研究生，有什么值得拿出来的东西，过去为了这个目标做了什么事情，有什么样的经验，导致我现在有什么样的能力，能够让我在未来能成为这样子的人才）

Please introduce yourself in English ?

I’d be happy to. Hello professors, thanks for having me, I’m Zhangxinlin and I’m from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, majoring in software engineering.

My friends say that I’m an easygoing, helpful and hard-working person. I consider myself a fast learner. In my free time, I like to read novels, especially science fictions. Other than that, I’ve always had great interest in English, it’s definitely one of my favorite subject.

During college, I was really into programming and Java is my favorite programming language. I even managed to finish the majority chapters of Thinking in Java. At the same time, I put a lot of sample code in this book on github.

After graduating from university, I successfully became a Java software engineer. But apparently the knowledge I have learned during college is not professional enough for me to be competent for some work, so I spent a lot of time on self-study and hope to be a good engineer. And now, to some extent, I do it.

It’s a pleasure to meet you professors, and I hope I will have a chance to get to know you better in the future.
